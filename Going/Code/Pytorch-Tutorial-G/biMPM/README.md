## Introduction
##### BiMPM: Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentences
Source code for natural language sentence matching.
<br/>
Only compute graph, basic layers and utils, train code may view in [Torch_light](https://github.com/ne7ermore/torch_light).
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, question and answer as input predict a label
You can use this program to deal with tasks like [paraphrase identification](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=Paraphrase_Identification_%28State_of_the_art%29), [natural language inference](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/), [duplicate questions identification](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) et al.
<br/>
<br/>
Code implemented from [BiMPM](https://github.com/zhiguowang/BiMPM/blob/master/README.md) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03814.pdf).

## Requirement
* python 3.5
* pytorch 0.2.0
